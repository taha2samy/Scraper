<h1>Scraper</h1>
<h2>The "Scraper" tool is a comprehensive web scraping solution that leverages both JavaScript and Python,
specifically the "eel" library. The tool is structured around a web server that renders web pages within an iframe, offering users a convenient interface for data extraction. Users can employ a JavaScript editor to interact with and scrape data from the displayed web page. What sets this tool apart is its seamless integration with Python, facilitated by the "eel" library. This integration allows users to call Python functions directly from the JavaScript code editor, enhancing the tool's versatility and enabling interactions with the operating system or any Python module.<h2></h2>
